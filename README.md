# **BJU**  
## A "Critique" of Modern Wokeness and the Decline of Game Enjoyment

Welcome to **BJU**, an RPG that serves as a biting criticism of the modern gaming landscape. In today's world, games often prioritize **adult content** and **surface-level social commentary** over gameplay enjoyment, all while using these elements as excuses for **unfinished, buggy messes**. **BJU** embraces this trend—by making everything worse!

This project was born out of boredom and frustration with current trends in game development. If you're sick of games that seem more concerned with shoehorning in *"edgy"* themes rather than delivering a complete, satisfying experience, then you're in for a ride.

## **Features** (If You Can Call Them That)

### 1. **Social Commentary That Means Nothing**
- An overabundance of adult themes thrown in just to be *"woke"* and *"relevant,"* without contributing anything meaningful to the gameplay.  
- Shallow character arcs that attempt to tackle social issues but end up being cringeworthy and irrelevant.

### 2. **Gameplay? What's That?**
- A game that actively avoids being fun. Why bother with tight controls or a balanced combat system when you can sprinkle in yet another clunky moral dilemma instead?  
- Mindless fetch quests padded with conversations about *"current social issues"* that nobody asked for.

### 3. **Unfinished & Broken Mechanics**
- A game that's half-finished, but hey, it's okay because it has *"thought-provoking"* adult content, right?  
- No meaningful progression, unpolished features, and a plethora of bugs. Because *unfinished is the new finished* in modern game development.

### 4. **Frustrating Adult-Themed Quests**
- Quests with explicit content that feel shoehorned in to distract from the fact that the actual gameplay mechanics are non-functional.  
- It's like the developers got halfway through coding, then decided, *"Let's just throw in some adult themes and call it a day."*

### 5. **Random NPC Wokeness**
- NPCs that constantly remind you of social justice issues, yet offer no valuable insights or gameplay relevance.  
- Dialogue that loops endlessly between preaching and not letting you actually get back to the game.

### 6. **A UI Designed to Annoy**
- UI with in-your-face notifications of *"mature content"* while your actual objectives are buried somewhere.  
- Random dialogue interruptions to make sure you never get too immersed in the gameplay.

## **How to Play** (Not That You’ll Want To)

1. Get it on Steam to support us (just like you do with all other companies)
2. Get it off here for free and run it inside Unreal Engine (we dont really care, just like AAA Companies)

### Development Goals
- Prioritize Content Over Gameplay: The goal here is to show what happens when developers focus on being socially relevant rather than actually making a functioning game.
- Critique Through Chaos: Highlighting the absurdity of using mature themes and unfinished content as a defense mechanism for poor game design.
- Ignore Feedback: Just like modern developers—why listen to feedback when you can throw more adult content at the problem?

### Contributing
Want to contribute to this disaster? Feel free! But remember: bad code, shallow social commentary, and unfinished features are the only things we’ll accept. Make it worse, not better.

### Known Bugs (Just Like Any Other Game)
- NPCs Stuck in Infinite Woke Loops: Once they start talking, they won’t stop.
- Missing Storylines: Half the quests just disappear once you reach certain stages of the game. It's a feature.
- Combat System?: We're still pretending to have one.

### Why Does This Exist?
BJU exists as a tongue-in-cheek critique of modern gaming, where it seems that focusing on being edgy or socially relevant has overtaken the desire to create fun, finished games. If you've ever felt that too much attention is paid to throwing in gratuitous adult content instead of actually delivering a quality gaming experience, this is the game that mocks it all.
